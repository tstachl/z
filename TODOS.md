# ToDo's

- [] forward gpg agent
It seems that it automatically chooses a folder under `/run/user` but if I auto-
create this folder, it chooses `~/.config/gnupg`. So I would have to auto-create
the folder and forward the agent to `~/.config/gnupg` for it to pick it up.
- [] project specific nvim configuration
- [] nix setup script for home-manager
- [] work on sting
- [] add nix-darwin configuration for meili
